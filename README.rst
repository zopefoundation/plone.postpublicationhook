Note
====

This package is provided for backwards compatibility. New code should use the
publication events introduced in Zope 2.12 directly.

For Zope 2.10, a backport of the publication events is available in
`ZPublisherEventsBackport`_. This is required for this package and may be added
to your buildout directly, or by specifying the 'Zope2.10' extra::

    eggs =
        Plone
        plone.postpublicationhook [Zope2.10]

Introduction
============

This package provides a hook into Zope's ZPublisher that is run after the
publisher has completed publication, but before the the transaction is committed
and the response is returned to the requesting browser. This is practical for
caching purposes: it is the ideal place to determine and insert caching headers
into the response.

Hooks use `zope.event`_'s event mechanism using the
plone.validatehook.interfaces.IPostValidationEvent. This is based on the
standard ObjectEvent from `zope.component`_.

Example
=======

As an example we will write a bit of code which logs the path of every published
object. This is the code for the event handler::

    from zope.interface import Interface
    from zope.component import adapter
    from plone.postpublicationhook.interfaces import IAfterPublicationEvent
    import logging

    logger = logging.getLogger("LogRequest")

    @adapter(Interface, IAfterPublicationEvent)
    def LogRequest(object, event):
        if getattr(object, "getPhysicalPath", None) is None:
            path="Unknown path"
        else:
            path="/".join(object.getPhysicalPath()

        logger.info("Request for object %s" % path)


To use this code you need to register it in zcml::

    <subscriber handler=".events.LogRequest" />

Using ZPublisher events directly
================================

The IPubBeforeCommit event is equivalent to the IAfterPublicationEvent,
however it is not an ObjectEvent so there are a few changes::

    from zope.component import adapter
    from ZPublisher.interfaces import IPubBeforeCommit
    import logging

    logger = logging.getLogger("LogRequest")

    @adapter(IPubBeforeCommit)
    def LogRequest(event):
        request = event.request
        object = request['PUBLISHED']
        if getattr(object, "getPhysicalPath", None) is None:
            path="Unknown path"
        else:
            path="/".join(object.getPhysicalPath()

        logger.info("Request for object %s" % path)


Register it in zcml the same way::

    <subscriber handler=".events.LogRequest" />
